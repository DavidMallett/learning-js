# Learning JS is fun!  
  
Hey y'all, if you're here, then I've probably offered to teach you a bit of coding at some point (so, like, 4 of y'all). This is a win-win for both of us: you get to learn a little basic Javascript, and I get better at teaching things to people!

You should complete the actions in the "Getting Started" section and you should end up with a project directory, a package.json, and a single file called "hello.js" in `{root}/src/js/`
  
Then you can proceed to...
